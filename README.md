# Customer-conversion-prediction

Welcome to the Customer-conversion-prediction- wiki!
## Project Goal
The goal of the Customer Conversion Prediction project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a client will subscribe to the insurance based on their demographic and marketing data. The project aims to help the insurance company identify the customers that are most likely to convert, so that they can be targeted via call and the cost of telephonic marketing campaigns can be reduced. The historical sales data provided will be used to train and evaluate the performance of the machine learning models. The analysis of the model will be done to identify the important factors that contribute towards the conversion and the AUROC metric will be used to evaluate the model's performance. The main objective of the project is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can aid the insurance company in improving its sales conversion rate and reducing marketing costs.

## Project Technologies used by me:
For this project, I utilized Google Colab as my integrated development environment (IDE) for programming in Python. Google Colab is a robust tool provided by Google that is well-suited for implementing machine learning algorithms, performing data analytics and cleaning operations, and developing data science models.

## Project Implementation Steps:

## 1.Libraries Import and Load Dataset
We have imported requrired libraries and also loaded [dataset](https://github.com/Shubh4545/Customer-conversion-prediction/blob/53c1bda14fe9d7de665f6d17ec3976c9d6e4fa31/dataset.csv)
